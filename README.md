- LinkedList

  - [ ] Implement the `.push` method, which adds a node to the end of the linked list
  - [ ] Implement the `.contains` method, which determines if a value is present in the list
  - Note: both `.push` and `.contains` need to be created before the tests for _either_ method will pass

  - HashTable
  - [ ] Implement the `.get` method, which retrieves a value that was previously inserted in the hash table
  - [ ] Implement the `.set` method, which sets a value to the hash table
  - [ ] Implement the `.remove` method, which removes a value from the hash table

- Binary Search Tree
  - [ ] Implement the `.add` method, which adds an element to the binary searchTree
  - [ ] Implement the `.contains` method, which determines if a value is contained in the tree
  - [ ] Implement the `.depthFirstPre` method, which applies a callback in depth first (preorder)
  - [ ] Implement the `.depthFirstIn` method, which applies a callback in depth first (inorder)
  - [ ] Implement the `.depthFirstPost` method, which applies a callback in depth first (postorder)
  - [ ] Implement the `.breadthFirst` method, which applies a callback in breadth first
